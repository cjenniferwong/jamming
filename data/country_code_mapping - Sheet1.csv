User-assigned code elements,,,
,,,
"User-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use these codes in the updating process of the standard. The following alpha-2 codes can be user-assigned: AA, QM to QZ, XA to XZ, and ZZ.[20] For example:",,,
,,,
"The International Standard Recording Code uses QM as a second country code for the United States, as it ran out of three-character registrant codes within the US prefix. It also uses ZZ for some registrants assigned directly.[21]",,,
"The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository assigns QO to represent Outlying Oceania (a multi-territory region containing Antarctica, Bouvet Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, the British Indian Ocean Territory, the French Southern Territories, and the United States Minor Outlying Islands), and ZZ to represent ""Unknown or Invalid Territory"". Before the adoption of the macroregion code EU by ISO, CLDR also used QU to represent the European Union.[22]",,,
The code QZ is being used by the World Intellectual Property Organization as an indicator for the Community Plant Variety Office.,,,
"The code XA is being used by Switzerland,[23] as a country code for the Canary Islands, although IC is already reserved for that purpose.",,,
"The code XK is being used by the European Commission,[24] the IMF, and SWIFT,[25] CLDR and other organizations as a temporary country code for Kosovo.[26]",,,
"The code XN is being used by the World Intellectual Property Organization as an indicator for the Nordic Patent Institute, an international organization common to Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.[27]",,,
The code XU is being used by the World Intellectual Property Organization as an indicator for the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants.,,,
The code XV is being used by the World Intellectual Property Organization as an indicator for the Visegrad Patent Institute.,,,
"The code XX is being used by the World Intellectual Property Organization as an indicator for unknown states, other entities or organizations.",,,
UN/LOCODE assigns XZ to represent installations in international waters.[7],,,
,,,
"Furthermore, the code element OO is designated as an escape code if the number of regular user-assigned code elements is not sufficient.[28]",,,
,,,
Reserved code elements,,,
,,,
"Reserved code elements are codes which have become obsolete, or are required in order to enable a particular user application of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific additional code elements for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes which it undertakes not to use for other than specified purposes during a limited or indeterminate period of time. The reserved alpha-2 codes can be divided into the following four categories: exceptional reservations, transitional reservations, indeterminate reservations, and codes currently agreed not to use.",,,
,,,
Exceptional reservations,,,
,,,
"Exceptionally reserved code elements are codes reserved at the request of national ISO member bodies, governments and international organizations, which are required in order to support a particular application, as specified by the requesting body and limited to such use; any further use of such code elements is subject to approval by the ISO 3166/MA. The following alpha-2 codes are currently exceptionally reserved:",,,

Transitional reservations,,,
,,,
Transitional reserved code elements are codes reserved after their deletion from ISO 3166-1. These codes may be used only during a transitional period of at least five years while new code elements that may have replaced them are taken into use. These codes may be reassigned by the ISO 3166/MA after the expiration of the transitional period. The following alpha-2 codes are currently transitionally reserved:,,,
